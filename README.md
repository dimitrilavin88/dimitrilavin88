### 🛠️ Featured Projects

Here are some of my featured projects showcased on my portfolio:

1. **Planno - Scheduling Platform** | [Code](https://github.com/dimitrilavin88/Planno) | [Live Demo](https://plannomeetings.vercel.app/?code=10b009c8-90be-4699-af23-9084fbb6d5b6)

   - **Description:** A full-stack scheduling platform that helps bishops create shareable booking links for interviews and meetings, enabling members to schedule directly from real-time availability.
   - **Problem:** Manual meeting coordination causes scheduling conflicts, missed appointments, and significant time spent on back-and-forth communication.
   - **Solution:** Shareable booking links with real-time availability, Google Calendar integration for automatic sync, and Apple Calendar download support for seamless cross-platform scheduling.
   - **Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, React, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Google Calendar API, Vercel

2. **TastyFood - Food Ordering Platform** | [Code](https://github.com/dimitrilavin88/TastyFood) | [Live Demo](https://tastyfooddelivery-production.up.railway.app/)

   - **Description:** A custom full-stack food ordering platform that enables local restaurants to accept online orders directly from customers, providing complete ordering and delivery management.
   - **Problem:** Restaurants lose 15-30% of revenue to third-party delivery services and lose direct customer relationships and control over pricing.
   - **Solution:** Direct customer ordering through role-based dashboards, eliminating commission fees and giving restaurants complete control over customer relationships, pricing, and delivery logistics.
   - **Tech Stack:** React, Vite, Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Railway

3. **Premier League MVP Predictor** | [Code](https://github.com/dimitrilavin88/Portfolio/tree/master/src/PremierLeague-PredictiveModel) | [Live Demo](../pages/fpl.html)
   - **Description:** A machine learning project that analyzes player statistics from the English Premier League to predict and determine MVP candidates based on comprehensive performance metrics.
   - **Problem:** MVP selection is often subjective and doesn't account for all relevant performance metrics, potentially overlooking players who contribute significantly across multiple categories.
   - **Solution:** XGBoost regression model trained on comprehensive player statistics (goals, assists, clean sheets, influence, creativity, threat) to objectively predict player value and identify top 25 MVP candidates using data-driven analysis.
   - **Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, XGBoost, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Kaggle API, Render
